# Bike-Rental-System
A bike Rental service is economically beneficial to users as they can purchase a subscription or to use a pay-per-ride system. The cost of bike sharing has been found to be more affordable than other forms of transportation. Buses, trains, and ride sharing can all be more expensive than bike sharing. Furthermore, sharing a bike will also eliminate the need for the users to maintain and repair their own bike.
Another benefit is that bike sharing is a very ecologically friendly means of transportation. It contributes much less to air and noise pollution than automobiles. Lower levels of noise and air pollution are beneficial to both the environment and to city residents. It also decreases the traffic and congestion often found in major cities. Depending on the size and traffic patterns of the city, using a bike could possibly be quicker than driving, riding a bus or riding a train.
